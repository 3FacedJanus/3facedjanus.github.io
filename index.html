<p><i>Planned Future Features (To be implemented post-Hitman 3 launch):</i></p><ul>
  <li><i>Loadout Roulette!</i></li>
  <li><i>Adding an option for specific kill conditions post-pacification (i.e., "Kill Kalvin Ritter with a pistol after pacifying him with a Bust.")</i></li>
  <li><i>Full compatibility with Hitman 3 and its campaign missions.</i></li>
  <li><i>A way to import/export option presets, plus a personal High Score option (maybe).</i></li>
  <li><i>More unique kill conditions (i.e., Pushing Dalia onto Viktor, massaging Strandberg, etc.)</i></li>
  <li><i>Kill condition probability sliders - set on a scale of 1 to 5 how often specific kill conditions can occur.</i></li>
  <li><i>Adjusting kill condition probabilities and fixing other bugs.</i></li>
  <li><i>Anything else that gets suggested that I can manage to put in!</i></li>
</ul>
